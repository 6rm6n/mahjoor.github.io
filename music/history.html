                <h1>A comprehensive overview of some of my musical stuff</h1>
                <p>This page will showcase my thoughts regarding some captured highlights of my musical moments.</p>

                <h4>Displaced</h4>
                <p>Vocals by arman and kaedefall, produced by yugen and lb66</p>

                <p>This song is definitely a banger, being the most played song I've vocalized on so far. This was the first song I created with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kaedefall" target="_blank">kaedefall</a>, one of my favorite creatives and someone I am honored to partner with on several musical compositions. To tell the full story about this song, I'll have to refer to the original piece, which was recorded on a beat by yugen and sense (@176s).</p>
                <p>I was in a discord server created by artist <a href="https://instagram.com/7ngelus/" target="_blank">Angelus</a>, where the producer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/1yugenn/" target="_blank">Yugen</a> shared a beat file. Upon hearing the beat drop, I downloaded it and imported it into FL Studio. The initial lines flowed out effortlessly.</p>

                    <source src="original_version_of_displaced.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
                </audio>
                <p>This was the original version of the song.</p>
                <p>yugen had other plans for the beat however, but decided on flipping the vocals that Kaedefall and I created. That is where they collaborated with lb66 on the dynamic, ecstatic, electric beat you hear accompanying our vocals.</p>

                <h4>Choir</h4>
                <p>If you're interested, here's some choir performances from my middle school days. You can find me if you look hard enough.</p>
