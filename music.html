            <article id="introduction">
                <p>music has always held a significant place in my heart, serving as a companion from my earliest days of learning basic addition to the present moment. Over time, I've delved deeply into the transformative art of sound, exploring it's many possibilites through instruments, vocals, production, and sound modification.</p>
                <p>My musical journey commenced with piano lessons at the age of seven with the late Dr. John Ackley. This was a discipline I pursued with him until I was 11 or 12. My interest expanded to include choir in the fourth grade, something I continued up until my 9th grade. Subsequently, my passion rekindled for the piano for another year where I took more lessons with Dr. John Ackley, before my exploration veered into the domains of electronic music production with the adoption of FL Studio.</p>                    
                <p>I embarked on creating digital music in the Spring of 2019, dedicating substantial time to it especially during the Covid-19 lockdown, until 2022. Nowadays, my musical expressions are sporadic, often finding solace in impromptu piano sessions or singing along to the timeless tunes of Chet Baker and Frank Sinatra while I'm driving around northern Virginia.</p>
