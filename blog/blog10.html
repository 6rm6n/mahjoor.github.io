                what it will be about
                - how i got into diving in high school
                - somehow made it to the varsity team
                - the dive team and coach baker
                - the self-confidence being on the team built into me
                - the mistakes that were made and the mental (fear, remembering what to do for dives) challenge dive was for me
                - getting 3rd in districts
                - competing in regionals
