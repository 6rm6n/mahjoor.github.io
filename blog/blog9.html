                what it will be about
                - how i was discriminated because of my identity
                - how i grew that into a part of my personality to use that as a validation
                - how being the bottom of the joke just became a part of my personality
                - the negative mental health effects it lead to
                - how i got sick of it and gave myself a greater self-worth
