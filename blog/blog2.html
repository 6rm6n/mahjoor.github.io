                I've been living in Virginia for 20 years. We have 3 of the most wealthiest counties in the United States of America. I was born in Fairfax city and ever since then I've grown up in Virginia, living in the Manassas area. I don't know where I'm headed after college, but I know I wish to explore what the world has to offer.
