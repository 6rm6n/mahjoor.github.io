            <h3>my craziest memory from korea</h3>
            <p>My craziest memory from Korea is a really interesting story, starting from a post on my Instagram story under my music profile, @6rm6n. What happened was that one of my listeners recognized I was in Korea, and messaged me asking about that.</p>
            <p>In response, I let him know I was there. He told me I should come to Daegu some time since that was where he was, and I was really interested. As someone outgoing that loves to meet new people and since I wanted to explore Korea, I knew this was the perfect opportunity to finally meet someone who listens to my music. 
                The thing was however, that he was in the U.S. military, and was getting sent back home in 11 days.
            <p>Despite the constraints, I knew this was an opportunity I couldn't pass on. It would be the perfect opportunity to try and see Daegu - considering I had never even met one of my music listeners in real life before and this was a part of Korea I was planning to see anyways.</p>
            <p>It had only been a couple of weeks since I got to Korea, and I hardly knew how to navigate the subway. But I had a feeling this was something I wouldn't regret, so I asked my Korean friend, Jake Choi if he wanted to come to Daegu with me. I was going to pay for his ticket, since he usually doesn't spend a lot of money on things.</p>
            <p>I also knew it would be the perfect opportunity to invite another friend, Matthew N. with me as well, since he was also friends with Jake and I. So we all ended up going together with the KTX. </p>
            <p>After we took the KTX and got to Daegu, we looked around a bit and after some time met up with one of Jake's friends, Jacob. I thought Jacob was one of the coolest people, and wanted to be his friend. It didn't take long for him to open up to me and we started sharing conversation.</p>
